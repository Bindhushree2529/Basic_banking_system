I used Eclipse IDE to run this project.

Steps to Run:

* Download and install Eclipse from the official website.
* Create a new Java project.(you can give any name for project)
* Create a package under your project.(it will be better to use same name for both project and package) 
* Create the BankAccount.java, Bank.java, and Main.java files in the src folder.
* Copy the respective code into these files.
* Right-click on Main.java and select "Run As" > "Java Application".
